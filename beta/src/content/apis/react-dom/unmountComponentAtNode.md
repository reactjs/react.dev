This section is incomplete, please see the old docs for [unmountComponentAtNode](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#unmountcomponentatnode).

<Intro>

Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns `true` if a component was unmounted and `false` if there was no component to unmount.

```js
unmountComponentAtNode(container)
```
