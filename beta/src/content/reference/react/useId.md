<Intro>

`useId` is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.

```js
const id = useId()
```

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useId()` {/*useid*/}

Call `useId` at the top level of your component to generate a unique ID:

```js
import { useId } from 'react';

function PasswordField() {
  const passwordHintId = useId();
  // ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

`useId` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useId` returns a unique ID string associated with this particular `useId` call in this particular component.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useId` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

* `useId` **should not be used to generate keys** in a list. [Keys should be generated from your data.](/learn/rendering-lists#where-to-get-your-key)

## Usage {/*usage*/}

<Pitfall>

**Do not call `useId` to generate keys in a list.** [Keys should be generated from your data.](/learn/rendering-lists#where-to-get-your-key)

### Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes {/*generating-unique-ids-for-accessibility-attributes*/}

Call `useId` at the top level of your component to generate a unique ID:

```js [[1, 4, "passwordHintId"]]
import { useId } from 'react';

function PasswordField() {
  const passwordHintId = useId();
  // ...
```

You can then pass the <CodeStep step={1}>generated ID</CodeStep> to different attributes:

```js [[1, 2, "passwordHintId"], [1, 3, "passwordHintId"]]
<>
  <input type="password" aria-describedby={passwordHintId} />
  <p id={passwordHintId}>
</>
```

**Let's walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

[HTML accessibility attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) like [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) let you specify that two tags are related to each other. For example, you can specify that a certain element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).

In regular HTML, you would write it like this:

```html {5,8}
<label>
  Password:
  <input
    type="password"
    aria-describedby="password-hint"
  />
</label>
<p id="password-hint">
  The password should contain at least 18 characters
</p>
```

However, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React. A component may be rendered more than once on the page--but IDs have to be unique! Instead of hardcoding an ID, you can generate a unique ID with `useId`:

```js {4,11,14}
import { useId } from 'react';

function PasswordField() {
  const passwordHintId = useId();
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}
        />
      </label>
      <p id={passwordHintId}>
        The password should contain at least 18 characters
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Now, even if `PasswordField` appears multiple times on the screen, the generated IDs won't clash.

```js
import { useId } from 'react';

function PasswordField() {
  const passwordHintId = useId();
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}
        />
      </label>
      <p id={passwordHintId}>
        The password should contain at least 18 characters
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Choose password</h2>
      <PasswordField />
      <h2>Confirm password</h2>
      <PasswordField />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
input { margin: 5px; }
```

<Pitfall>

**`useId` requires an identical component tree on the server and the client** when you use [server rendering](/reference/react-dom/server). If the trees you render on the server and the client don't match exactly, the generated IDs won't match.

</Pitfall>

<DeepDive>

#### Why is useId better than an incrementing counter? {/*why-is-useid-better-than-an-incrementing-counter*/}

You might be wondering why `useId` is better than incrementing a global variable like `nextId++`.

The primary benefit of `useId` is that React ensures that it works with [server rendering.](/reference/react-dom/server) During server rendering, your components generate HTML output. Later, on the client, [hydration](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) attaches your event handlers to the generated HTML. For hydration to work, the client output must match the server HTML.

This is very difficult to guarantee with an incrementing counter because the order in which the client components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML was emitted. By calling `useId`, you ensure that hydration will work, and the output will match between the server and the client.

Inside React, `useId` is generated from the "parent path" of the calling component. This is why, if the client and the server tree are the same, the "parent path" will match up regardless of rendering order.

### Generating IDs for several related elements {/*generating-ids-for-several-related-elements*/}

If you need to give IDs to multiple related elements, you can call `useId` to generate a shared prefix for them: 

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useId } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor={id + '-firstName'}>First Name:</label>
      <input id={id + '-firstName'} type="text" />
      <hr />
      <label htmlFor={id + '-lastName'}>Last Name:</label>
      <input id={id + '-lastName'} type="text" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
input { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This lets you avoid calling `useId` for every single element that needs a unique ID.

---

### Specifying a shared prefix for all generated IDs {/*specifying-a-shared-prefix-for-all-generated-ids*/}

If you render multiple independent React applications on a single page, you may pass `identifierPrefix` as an option to your [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#parameters) or [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) calls. This ensures that the IDs generated by the two different apps never clash because every identifier generated with `useId` will start with the distinct prefix you've specified.

<Sandpack>

```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>My app</title></head>
  <body>
    <div id="root1"></div>
    <div id="root2"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js
import { useId } from 'react';

function PasswordField() {
  const passwordHintId = useId();
  console.log('Generated identifier:', passwordHintId)
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}
        />
      </label>
      <p id={passwordHintId}>
        The password should contain at least 18 characters
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Choose password</h2>
      <PasswordField />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js index.js active
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.js';
import './styles.css';

const root1 = createRoot(document.getElementById('root1'), {
  identifierPrefix: 'my-first-app-'
});
root1.render(<App />);

const root2 = createRoot(document.getElementById('root2'), {
  identifierPrefix: 'my-second-app-'
});
root2.render(<App />);
```

```css
#root1 {
  border: 5px solid blue;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
}

#root2 {
  border: 5px solid green;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
}

input { margin: 5px; }
```
