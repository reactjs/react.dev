<Intro>

`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used in React as replacement for using `innerHTML` property for DOM elements.

</Intro>

<Note>

In general, setting HTML from code is risky because it’s easy to inadvertently expose your users to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack. It is ok to set it **if you really trust the HTML**. For example, if HTML is generated by a Markdown library, or when the content is sanitized by the server, etc.


You can use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and pass an object with a `__html` key.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property {/*using-the-dangerouslysetinnerhtml-property*/}

In the example below, `MyComponent` is being rendered that returns a `<textarea>` where you can enter a text in Markdown. The converted output is to be returned in the `<div>` whose innterHTML text is being set using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property. Here, we trust the HTML as we are entering it in the input area.

As demonstrated, it is important not to forget to **pass an object with a `__html` key**.

<Sandpack>

``` js App.js
import React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Hello, **world**!");
  const md = new ReactMarkdown();

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value)

  const getRawMarkup = {__html: md.render(value)};

    return (
      <div className="MarkdownEditor">
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <label htmlFor="markdown-content">
          Enter some markdown
        </label>
        <textarea
          id="markdown-content"
          onChange={handleChange}
          defaultValue={value}
        />
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <div
          className="content"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={getRawMarkup}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```
