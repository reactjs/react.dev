title: dangerouslySetInnerHTML
---

<Intro>

`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used in React as a replacement for using `innerHTML` property for DOM elements.

</Intro>

<Note>

In general, setting HTML from code is risky because it’s easy to inadvertently expose your users to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack. It is ok to set it **if you really trust the HTML**. For example, if HTML is generated by a Markdown library, or when the content is sanitized by the server. If you set HTML directly from React, you **must** type out `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and pass an object with an `__html` key to remind yourself that it's dangerous.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property {/*using-the-dangerouslysetinnerhtml-property*/}

In this example, `MyComponent` returns a `<textarea>` where you can enter text in Markdown. The converted output will be returned in the `<div>` whose innerHTML text is set using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property. Here, we trust the HTML as we are entering it in the input area.

As demonstrated, it is important to always **pass an object with a `__html` key**.
