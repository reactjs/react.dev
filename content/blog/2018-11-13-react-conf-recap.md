Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov kicked off Day 1 with their keynote, React Today and Tomorrow. In the talk, they introduced [Hooks](/docs/hooks-intro.html), which are a new proposal that adds the ability to access features such as state without writing a JavaScript class. Hooks promise to dramatically simplify the code required for React components and are currently available in a React alpha release.

On the morning of Day 2, Andrew Clark and Brian Vaughn presented Concurrent Rendering in React. Andrew covered the recently announced [React.lazy API for code splitting](/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html) and previewed two upcoming features: concurrent mode and Suspense. Brian demonstrated how to use [React’s new profiler](/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) tooling to make apps built in React run faster.

In the afternoon, Parashuram N spoke in detail about React Native’s New Architecture, a long-term project that the React Native team has been working on over the past year and [announced in June](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018). We’re really excited about the potential of this project to improve performance, simplify interoperability with other libraries, and set a strong foundation for the future of React Native.

Now that the conference is over, all 28 conference talks are [available to stream online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ). There are tons of great ones from both days. We can’t wait until next year!
