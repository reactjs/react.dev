Try React online or set up your local dev environment

## Online

If you're just interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on [CodePen](codepen://hello-world) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s).

## HTML Template

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also [download this HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don't use it in production.

## Next Steps

### Quick Start

Head over to the [Quick Start](/docs/hello-world.html) section to try some examples.

### Install React

If you are ready to add React to your app, check out the install guides:

- **[Add React to a New App](/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)** Create a new app with a starter kit like [Create React App](http://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- **[Add React to an Existing App](/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)** Add React to a build system or larger app.
