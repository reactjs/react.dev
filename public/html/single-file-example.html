      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
