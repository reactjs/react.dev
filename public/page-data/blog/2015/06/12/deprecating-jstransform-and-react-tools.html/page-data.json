JSTransform has been really good for us over the past several years, however as the JavaScript language continues to evolve, the architecture we used has begun to show its age. We’ve faced maintenance issues and lagged behind implementing new language features. Last year, Babel (previously 6to5) exploded onto the scene, implementing new features at an amazing pace. Since then it has evolved a solid plugin API, and implemented some of our non-standard language features (JSX and Flow type annotations).</p>\n<p>react-tools has always been a very thin wrapper around JSTransform. It has served as a great tool for the community to get up and running, but at this point we’re ready to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">let it go</a>.

The upstream Esprima and other esprima-based forks, like Espree, have been doing an excellent job of supporting new language features recently. If you have a need of an esprima-based parser, we encourage you to look into using one of those.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you need to parse JSX, take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">acorn</a> parser in combination with <a href=\"https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">acorn-jsx</a> plugin which is used inside of Babel and thus always supports the latest syntax.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jsxtransformer\"><a href=\"#jsxtransformer\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>JSXTransformer </h3>\n<p>JSXTransformer is another tool we built specifically for consuming JSX in the browser. It was always intended as a quick way to prototype code before setting up a build process. It would look for <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;script></code> tags with <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">type=\"text/jsx\"</code> and then transform and run. This ran the same code that react-tools ran on the server. Babel ships with <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/browser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a nearly identical tool</a>, which has already been integrated into <a href=\"https://jsbin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JS Bin</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ll be deprecating JSXTransformer, however the current version will still be available from various CDNs and Bower.</p>","excerpt":"Today we’re announcing the deprecation of react-tools and JSTransform.
