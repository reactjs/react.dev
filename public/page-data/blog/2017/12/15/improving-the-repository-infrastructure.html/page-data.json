People often ask us questions about how we use those tools. In this post, we would like to share some of the changes that we’ve made to our build and test infrastructure in 2017, and what motivated them.</p>\n<p>While these changes helped us make React better, they don’t affect most React users directly. However, we hope that blogging about them might help other library authors solve similar problems.

This made it easier to coordinate changes and share the tooling, but our folder structure was deeply nested and difficult to understand. It was not clear which files belonged to which package. After releasing React 16, we’ve decided to completely reorganize the repository structure. Here is how we did it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-to-yarn-workspaces\"><a href=\"#migrating-to-yarn-workspaces\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Migrating to Yarn Workspaces </h3>\n<p>The Yarn package manager <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">introduced a feature called Workspaces</a> a few months ago. This feature lets you tell Yarn where your monorepo’s packages are located in the source tree. Every time you run <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">yarn</code>, in addition to installing your dependencies it also sets up the symlinks that point from your project’s <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">node_modules</code> to the source folders of your packages.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Workspaces, absolute imports between our own packages (such as importing <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react</code> from <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom</code>) “just work” with any tools that support the Node resolution mechanism. The only problem we encountered was Jest not running the transforms inside the linked packages, but we <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/4761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">found a fix</a>, and it was merged into Jest.</p>\n<p>To enable Yarn Workspaces, we added <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">\"workspaces\": [\"packages/*\"]</code> to our <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/package.json#L4-L6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">package.json</code></a>, and moved all the code into <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">top-level <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">packages/*</code> folders</a>, each with its own <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>Each package is structured in a similar way. For every public API entry point such as <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom</code> or <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom/server</code>, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/react-dom/index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">file</a> in the package root folder that re-exports the implementation from the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/react-dom/src\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">/src/</code></a> subfolder. The decision to point entry points to the source rather than to the built versions was intentional. Typically, we re-run a subset of tests after every change during development. Having to build the project to run a test would have been prohibitively slow. When we publish packages to npm, we replace these entry points with files in the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/react-dom/npm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">/npm/</code></a> folder that point to the build artifacts.</p>\n<p>Not all packages have to be published on npm. For example, we keep some utilities that are tiny enough and can be safely duplicated in a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/shared\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">pseudo-package called <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">shared</code></a>. Our bundler is configured to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/build.js#L326-L329\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">only treat <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">dependencies</code> declared from <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">package.json</code> as externals</a> so it happily bundles the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">shared</code> code into <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react</code> and <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom</code> without leaving any references to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">shared/</code> in the build artifacts. So you can use Yarn Workspaces even if you don’t plan to publish actual npm packages!</p>\n<h3 id=\"removing-the-custom-module-system\"><a href=\"#removing-the-custom-module-system\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Removing the Custom Module System </h3>\n<p>In the past, we used a non-standard module system called “Haste” that lets you import any file from any other file by its unique <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">@providesModule</code> directive no matter where it is in the tree. It neatly avoids the problem of deep relative imports with paths like <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">../../../../</code> and is great for the product code. However, this makes it hard to understand the dependencies between packages. We also had to resort to hacks to make it work with different tools.</p>\n<p>We decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11303\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">remove Haste</a> and use the Node resolution with relative imports instead. To avoid the problem of deep relative paths, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">flattened our repository structure</a> so that it goes at most one level deep inside each package:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">|-react\n|  |-npm\n|  |-src\n|-react-dom\n|  |-npm\n|  |-src\n|  |  |-client\n|  |  |-events\n|  |  |-server\n|  |  |-shared</code></pre></div>\n<p>This way, the relative paths can only contain one <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">./</code> or <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">../</code> followed by the filename. If one package needs to import something from another package, it can do so with an absolute import from a top-level entry point.</p>\n<p>In practice, we still have <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMFiberComponent.js#L10-L11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">some cross-package “internal” imports</a> that violate this principle, but they’re explicit, and we plan to gradually get rid of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compiling-flat-bundles\"><a href=\"#compiling-flat-bundles\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Compiling Flat Bundles </h2>\n<p>Historically, React was distributed in two different formats: as a single-file build that you can add as a <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;script></code> tag in the browser, and as a collection of CommonJS modules that you can bundle with a tool like webpack or Browserify. </p>\n<p>Before React 16, each React source file had a corresponding CommonJS module that was published as part of the npm packages. Importing <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react</code> or <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom</code> led bundlers to the package <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@15/index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">entry point</a> from which they would build a dependency tree with the CommonJS modules in the <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@15/lib/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">internal <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">lib</code> folder</a>.</p>\n<p>However, this approach had multiple disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It was inconsistent.</strong> Different tools produce bundles of different sizes for identical code importing React, with the difference going as far as 30 kB (before gzip).</li>\n<li><strong>It was inefficient for bundler users.</strong> The code produced by most bundlers today contains a lot of “glue code” at the module boundaries. It keeps the modules isolated from each other, but increases the parse time, the bundle size, and the build time.</li>\n<li><strong>It was inefficient for Node users.</strong> When running in Node, performing <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">process.env.NODE_ENV</code> checks before development-only code incurs the overhead of actually looking up environment variables. This slowed down React server rendering. We couldn’t cache it in a variable either because it prevented dead code elimination with Uglify.</li>\n<li><strong>It broke encapsulation.</strong> React internals were exposed both in the open source (as <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom/lib/*</code> imports) and internally at Facebook. It was convenient at first as a way to share utilities between projects, but with time it became a maintenance burden because renaming or changing argument types of internal functions would break unrelated projects.</li>\n<li><strong>It prevented experimentation.</strong> There was no way for the React team to experiment with any advanced compilation techniques. For example, in theory, we might want to apply <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google Closure Compiler Advanced</a> optimizations or <a href=\"https://prepack.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Prepack</a> to some of our code, but they are designed to work on complete bundles rather than small individual modules that we used to ship to npm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to these and other issues, we’ve changed the strategy in React 16. We still ship CommonJS modules for Node.js and bundlers, but instead of publishing many individual files in the npm package, we publish just two CommonJS bundles per entry point.</p>\n<p>For example, when you import <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react</code> with React 16, the bundler <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">finds the entry point</a> that just re-exports one of the two files:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token string\">'use strict'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>process<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>env<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">NODE_ENV</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">'production'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  module<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./cjs/react.production.min.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  module<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./cjs/react.development.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In every package provided by React, the <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/cjs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">cjs</code> folder</a> (short for “CommonJS”) contains a development and a production pre-built bundle for each entry point. </p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/cjs/react.development.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react.development.js</code></a> is the version intended for development. It is readable and includes comments. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/cjs/react.production.min.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react.production.min.js</code></a> was minified and optimized before it was published to npm.</p>\n<p>Note how this is essentially the same strategy that we’ve been using for the single-file browser builds (which now reside in the <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">umd</code> directory</a>, short for <a href=\"https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Universal Module Definition</a>). Now we just apply the same strategy to the CommonJS builds as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-to-rollup\"><a href=\"#migrating-to-rollup\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Migrating to Rollup </h3>\n<p>Just compiling CommonJS modules into single-file bundles doesn’t solve all of the above problems. The really significant wins came from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">migrating our build system</a> from Browserify to <a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rollup</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rollup was designed with libraries rather than apps in mind</a>, and it is a perfect fit for React’s use case. It solves one problem well: how to combine multiple modules into a flat file with minimal junk code in between. To achieve this, instead of turning modules into functions like many other bundlers, it puts all the code in the same scope, and renames variables so that they don’t conflict.

After releasing React 16, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">we have converted the entire React source code</a> to the ES Modules syntax.</p>\n<p>Not only did this provide some extra protection, but it also helped improve the build size.

However, even though we try to keep the differences between the development and production code paths minimal, occasionally we would make a mistake in production-only code branches that weren’t covered by tests, and cause an issue at Facebook.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, we have added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/package.json#L110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">yarn test-prod</code></a> command that runs on CI for every pull request, and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11616\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">executes all React test cases in the production mode</a>. We wrapped any assertions about warning messages into development-only conditional blocks in all tests so that they can still check the rest of the expected behavior in both environments. Since we have a custom Babel transform that replaces production error messages with the <a href=\"/blog/2016/07/11/introducing-reacts-error-code-system.html\">error codes</a>, we also added a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/jest/setupTests.js#L91-L126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">reverse transformation</a> as part of the production test run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-public-api-in-tests\"><a href=\"#using-public-api-in-tests\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using Public API in Tests </h3>\n<p>When we were <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/1716776591680069/react-16-a-look-inside-an-api-compatible-rewrite-of-our-frontend-ui-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rewriting the React reconciler</a>, we recognized the importance of writing tests against the public API instead of internal modules. If the test is written against the public API, it is clear what is being tested from the user’s perspective, and you can run it even if you rewrite the implementation from scratch.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the wonderful React community <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11299\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">asking for help</a> converting the remaining tests to use the public API. Almost all of the tests are converted now! The process wasn’t easy. Sometimes a unit test just calls an internal method, and it’s hard to figure out what the observable behavior from user’s point of view was supposed to be tested. We found a few strategies that helped with this. The first thing we would try is to find the git history for when the test was added, and find clues in the issue and pull request description. Often they would contain reproducing cases that ended up being more valuable than the original unit tests! A good way to verify the guess is to try commenting out individual lines in the source code being tested. If the test fails, we know for sure that it stresses the given code path.</p>\n<p>We would like to give our deepest thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Apr+11299+is%3Aclosed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">everyone who contributed to this effort</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"running-tests-on-compiled-bundles\"><a href=\"#running-tests-on-compiled-bundles\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Running Tests on Compiled Bundles </h3>\n<p>There is also one more benefit to writing tests against the public API: now we can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">run them against the compiled bundles</a>.</p>\n<p>This helps us ensure that tools like Babel, Rollup, and Google Closure Compiler don’t introduce any regressions. This also opens the door for future more aggressive optimizations, as we can be confident that React still behaves exactly as expected after them.</p>\n<p>To implement this, we have created a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/jest/config.build.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">second Jest config</a>. It overrides our default config but points <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react</code>, <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">react-dom</code>, and other entry points to the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">/build/packages/</code> folder. This folder doesn’t contain any React source code, and reflects what gets published to npm. It is populated after you run <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">yarn build</code>.</p>\n<p>This lets us run the same exact tests that we normally run against the source, but execute them using both development and production pre-built React bundles produced with Rollup and Google Closure Compiler.</p>\n<p>Unlike the normal test run, the bundle test run depends on the build products so it is not great for quick iteration. However, it still runs on the CI server so if something breaks, the test will display as failed, and we will know it’s not safe to merge into main.</p>\n<p>There are still some test files that we intentionally don’t run against the bundles. Sometimes we want to mock an internal module or override a feature flag that isn’t exposed to the public yet. For those cases, we blacklist a test file by renaming it from <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">MyModule-test.js</code> to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">MyModule-test.internal.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Currently, over 93% out of 2,650 React tests run against the compiled bundles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linting-compiled-bundles\"><a href=\"#linting-compiled-bundles\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Linting Compiled Bundles </h3>\n<p>In addition to linting our source code, we run a much more limited set of lint rules (really, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/validate/eslintrc.cjs.js#L26-L27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">just two of them</a>) on the compiled bundles.

For example, we use the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">files</code> field in our <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">package.json</code> files to specify a whitelist of folders and files that should be published on npm. However, it is easy to add a new entry point to a package but forget to add it to the whitelist. Even the bundle tests would pass, but after publishing the new entry point would be missing.</p>\n<p>To avoid situations like this, we are now simulating the npm publish by <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/packaging.js#L129-L134\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">running <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">npm pack</code> and then immediately unpacking the archive</a> after the build. Just like <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">npm publish</code>, this command filters out anything that isn’t in the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">files</code> whitelist. With this approach, if we were to forget adding an entry point to the list, it would be missing in the build folder, and the bundle tests relying on it would fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-manual-test-fixtures\"><a href=\"#creating-manual-test-fixtures\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Creating Manual Test Fixtures </h3>\n<p>Our unit tests run only in the Node environment, but not in the browsers. This was an intentional decision because browser-based testing tools were flaky in our experience, and didn’t catch many issues anyway.</p>\n<p>We could get away with this because the code that touches the DOM is consolidated in a few files, and doesn’t change that often. Every week, we update the Facebook.com codebase to the latest React commit on master. At Facebook, we use a set of internal <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WebDriver</a> tests for critical product workflows, and these catch some regressions. React updates are first delivered to employees, so severe bugs get reported immediately before they reach two billion users.</p>\n<p>Still, it was hard to review DOM-related changes, and occasionally we would make mistakes. In particular, it was hard to remember all the edge cases that the code had to handle, why they were added, and when it was safe to remove them. We considered adding some automatic tests that run in the browser but we didn’t want to slow down the development cycle and deal with a fragile CI. Additionally, automatic tests don’t always catch DOM issues. For example, an input value displayed by the browser may not match what it reports as a DOM property.</p>\n<p>We’ve chatted about this with <a href=\"https://github.com/aweary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brandon Dail</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jquense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jason Quense</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/nhunzaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nathan Hunzaker</a>. They were sending substantial patches to React DOM but were frustrated that we failed to review them timely. We decided to give them commit access, but asked them to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8589\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">create a set of manual tests</a> for DOM-related areas like input management. The initial set of manual fixtures <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/commits/main/fixtures/dom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">kept growing</a> over the year.</p>\n<p>These fixtures are implemented as a React app located in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/fixtures/dom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">fixtures/dom</code></a>. Adding a fixture involves writing a React component with a description of the expected behavior, and links to the appropriate issues and browser quirks, like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">in this example</a>:</p>\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590904/33555298-dd52fb4e-d8cd-11e7-80e9-8369538eb633.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\" alt=\"DOM fixture example\">\n<p>The fixture app lets you choose a version of React (local or one of the published versions) which is handy for comparing the behavior before and after the changes. When we change the behavior related to how we interact with the DOM, we can verify that it didn’t regress by going through the related fixtures in different browsers.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a change proved to be so complex that it necessitated a standalone purpose-built fixture to verify it. For example, the <a href=\"/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html\">DOM attribute handling in React 16</a> was very hard to pull off with confidence at first. We kept discovering different edge cases, and almost gave up on doing it in time for the React 16 release. However, then we’ve built an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/fixtures/attribute-behavior\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“attribute table” fixture</a> that renders all supported attributes and their misspellings with previous and next version of React, and displays the differences. It took a few iterations (the key insight was to group attributes with similar behavior together) but it ultimately allowed us to fix all major issues in just a few days.</p>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We went through the table to vet the new behavior for every case (and discovered some old bugs too) <a href=\"https://t.co/cmF2qnK9Q9\">pic.twitter.com/cmF2qnK9Q9</a></p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/906244378066345984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Going through the fixtures is still a lot of work, and we are considering automating some of it. Still, the fixture app is invaluable even as documentation for the existing behavior and all the edge cases and browser bugs that React currently handles. Having it gives us confidence in making significant changes to the logic without breaking important use cases. Another improvement we’re considering is to have a GitHub bot build and deploy the fixtures automatically for every pull request that touches the relevant files so anyone can help with browser testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preventing-infinite-loops\"><a href=\"#preventing-infinite-loops\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Preventing Infinite Loops </h3>\n<p>The React 16 codebase contains many <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">while</code> loops. They let us avoid the dreaded deep stack traces that occurred with earlier versions of React, but can make development of React really difficult. Every time there is a mistake in an exit condition our tests would just hang, and it took a while to figure out which of the loops is causing the issue.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"https://repl.it/site/blog/infinite-loops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">strategy adopted by Repl.it</a>, we have added a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/scripts/babel/transform-prevent-infinite-loops.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Babel plugin that prevents infinite loops</a> in the test environment. If some loop continues for more than the maximum allowed number of iterations, we throw an error and immediately fail it so that Jest can display where exactly this happened.</p>\n<p>This approach has a pitfall. If an error thrown from the Babel plugin gets caught and ignored up the call stack, the test will pass even though it has an infinite loop. This is really, really bad. To solve this problem, we <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/scripts/babel/transform-prevent-infinite-loops.js#L26-L30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">set a global field</a> before throwing the error. Then, after every test run, we <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/scripts/jest/setupTests.js#L42-L56\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rethrow that error if the global field has been set</a>. This way any infinite loop will cause a test failure, no matter whether the error from the Babel plugin was caught or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customizing-the-build\"><a href=\"#customizing-the-build\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Customizing the Build </h2>\n<p>There were a few things that we had to fine-tune after introducing our new build process.

We <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/build.js#L223-L226\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">replace</a> the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">__DEV__</code> literal with a boolean constant during the build, and both Rollup together and Google Closure Compiler can strip out the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">if (false) {}</code> code branches and even some more sophisticated patterns. However, there is one particularly nasty case:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> warning <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'fbjs/lib/warning'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>__DEV__<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">warning</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Blimey!'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This pattern is very common in the React source code. However <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">fbjs/lib/warning</code> is an external import that isn’t being bundled by Rollup for the CommonJS bundle. Therefore, even if <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">warning()</code> call ends up being removed, Rollup doesn’t know whether it’s safe to remove to the import itself. What if the module performs a side effect during initialization?

However, if it <em>is</em> being used (e.g. if we decide to add warnings in production), the import will be preserved. That’s why this approach is safer than replacing modules with empty shims.</p>\n<p>When we optimize something, we need to ensure it doesn’t regress in the future.

For example, React Native bundles have a different error handling mechanism that shows a redbox instead of printing a message to the console. However, it can be very inconvenient to thread these differences all the way through the calling modules.</p>\n<p>Problems like this are often solved with runtime configuration. However, sometimes it is impossible: for example, the React DOM bundles shouldn’t even attempt to import the React Native redbox helpers. It is also unfortunate to bundle the code that never gets used in a particular environment.</p>\n<p>Another solution is to use dynamic dependency injection. However, it often produces code that is hard to understand, and may cause cyclical dependencies. It also defies some optimization opportunities.</p>\n<p>From the code point of view, ideally we just want to “redirect” a module to its different “forks” for specific bundles. The “forks” have the exact same API as the original modules, but do something different. We found this mental model very intuitive, and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/forks.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">created a fork configuration file</a> that specifies how the original modules map to their forks, and the conditions under which this should happen.</p>\n<p>For example, this fork config entry specifies different <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/shared/ReactFeatureFlags.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">feature flags</a> for different bundles:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token string-property property\">'shared/ReactFeatureFlags'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">bundleType<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> entry</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">switch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>entry<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react-native-renderer'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token string\">'shared/forks/ReactFeatureFlags.native.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react-cs-renderer'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token string\">'shared/forks/ReactFeatureFlags.native-cs.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">switch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>bundleType<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token constant\">FB_DEV</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token constant\">FB_PROD</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n          <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token string\">'shared/forks/ReactFeatureFlags.www.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>During the build, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/scripts/rollup/plugins/use-forks-plugin.js#L40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">our custom Rollup plugin</a> replaces modules with their forks if the conditions have matched. Since both the original modules and the forks are written as ES Modules, Rollup and Google Closure Compiler can inline constants like numbers or booleans, and thus efficiently eliminate dead code for disabled feature flags. In tests, when necessary, we <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/react-cs-renderer/src/__tests__/ReactNativeCS-test.internal.js#L15-L17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">use <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">jest.mock()</code></a> to point the module to the appropriate forked version.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, we might want to verify that the export types of the original modules match the export types of the forks exactly. We can use a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095/packages/shared/forks/ReactFeatureFlags.native.js#L32-L36\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">slightly odd but totally working Flow trick</a> to accomplish this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">typeof</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> FeatureFlagsType <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'shared/ReactFeatureFlags'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">typeof</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> FeatureFlagsShimType <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'./ReactFeatureFlags.native'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ntype Check<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>_X<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token constant\">Y</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> _X<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token constant\">X</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token constant\">Y</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> _X<span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Check<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>FeatureFlagsShimType<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> FeatureFlagsType<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This works by essentially forcing Flow to verify that two types are assignable to each other (and thus are equivalent). Now if we modify the exports of either the original module or the fork without changing the other file, the type check will fail. This might be a little goofy but we found this helpful in practice.</p>\n<p>To conclude this section, it is important to note that you can’t specify your own module forks if you consume React from npm. This is intentional because none of these files are public API, and they are not covered by the <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">semver</a> guarantees. However, you are always welcome to build React from master or even fork it if you don’t mind the instability and the risk of divergence. We hope that this writeup was still helpful in documenting one possible approach to targeting different environments from a single JavaScript library.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tracking-bundle-size\"><a href=\"#tracking-bundle-size\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tracking Bundle Size </h3>\n<p>As a final build step, we now <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/scripts/rollup/build.js#L264-L272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">record build sizes for all bundles</a> and write them to a file that <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d906de7f602df810c38aa622c83023228b047db6/scripts/rollup/results.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">looks like this</a>.
