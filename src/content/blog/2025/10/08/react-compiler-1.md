We are releasing the compiler's first stable release today. React Compiler works on both React and React Native, and automatically optimizes components and hooks without requiring rewrites. The compiler has been battle tested on major apps at Meta and is fully production-ready.

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) is a build-time tool that optimizes your React app through automatic memoization. Last year, we published React Compiler's [first beta](/blog/2024/10/21/react-compiler-beta-release) and received lots of great feedback and contributions. We're excited about the wins we've seen from folks adopting the compiler (see case studies from [Sanity Studio](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler/discussions/33) and [Wakelet](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler/discussions/52)) and are excited to bring the compiler to more users in the React community. You can jump straight to the [quickstart](/learn/react-compiler), or read on for the highlights from React Conf 2025.

#### How does React Compiler work?

React Compiler is an optimizing compiler that optimizes components and hooks through automatic memoization. While it is implemented as a Babel plugin currently, the compiler is largely decoupled from Babel and lowers the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) provided by Babel into its own novel High-level Intermediate Representation (HIR), and through multiple compiler passes, carefully understands data-flow and mutability of your React code. This allows the compiler to granularly memoize values used in rendering, including the ability to memoize conditionally, which is not possible through manual memoization.

In addition to automatic memoization, React Compiler also has validation passes that run on your React code. These passes encode the [Rules of React](/reference/rules), and uses the compiler's understanding of data-flow and mutability to provide diagnostics where the Rules of React are broken. These diagnostics often expose latent bugs hiding in React code, and are primarily surfaced through `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.

## Use React Compiler Today {/*use-react-compiler-today*/}
To install the compiler:

npm
<TerminalBlock>
{`npm install --save-dev --save-exact babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

pnpm
<TerminalBlock>
{`pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

yarn
<TerminalBlock>
{`yarn add --dev --exact babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

As part of the stable release, we've been making React Compiler easier to add to your projects and added optimizations to how the compiler generates memoization. React Compiler now supports optional chains and array indices as dependencies. We're exploring how to infer even more dependencies like equality checks and string interpolation. These improvements ultimately result in fewer re-renders and more responsive UIs, while letting you keep writing idiomatic declarative code.

You can find more details on using the Compiler in [our docs](/learn/react-compiler).

## Backwards Compatibility {/*backwards-compatibility*/}
As noted in the Beta announcement, React Compiler is compatible with React 17 and up. If you are not yet on React 19, you can use React Compiler by specifying a minimum target in your compiler config, and adding `react-compiler-runtime` as a dependency. You can find docs on this [here](/reference/react-compiler/target#targeting-react-17-or-18).

## Enforce the Rules of React with compiler-powered linting {/*migrating-from-eslint-plugin-react-compiler-to-eslint-plugin-react-hooks*/}
React Compiler includes an ESLint rule that helps identify code that breaks the [Rules of React](/reference/rules). The linter does not require the compiler to be installed, so there's no risk in upgrading eslint-plugin-react-hooks. We recommend everyone upgrade today.

If you have already installed `eslint-plugin-react-compiler`, you can now remove it and use `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest`. Many thanks to [@michaelfaith](https://bsky.app/profile/michael.faith) for contributing to this improvement!

To install:

npm
<TerminalBlock>
{`npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

pnpm
<TerminalBlock>
{`pnpm add --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

yarn
<TerminalBlock>
{`yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

```js {6}
// eslint.config.js (Flat Config)
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';
import { defineConfig } from 'eslint/config';

export default defineConfig([
  reactHooks.configs.flat.recommended,
]);
```

```js {3}
// eslintrc.json (Legacy Config)
{
  "extends": ["plugin:react-hooks/recommended"],
  // ...
}
```

To enable React Compiler rules, we recommend using the `recommended` preset. You can also check out the [README](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/README.md) for more instructions. Here are a few examples we featured at React Conf:

- Catching `setState` patterns that cause render loops with [`set-state-in-render`](/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/set-state-in-render).
- Flagging expensive work inside effects via [`set-state-in-effect`](/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/set-state-in-effect).
- Preventing unsafe ref access during render with [`refs`](/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/refs).

## Adopt React Compiler incrementally {/*adopt-react-compiler-incrementally*/}
If you're maintaining an existing application, you can roll out the compiler at your own pace. We published a step-by-step [incremental adoption guide](/learn/react-compiler/incremental-adoption) that covers gating strategies, compatibility checks, and rollout tooling so you can enable the compiler with confidence.

## swc support (experimental) {/*swc-support-experimental*/}
React Compiler can be installed across [several build tools](/learn/react-compiler#installation) such as Babel, Vite, and Rsbuild.

In addition to those tools, we have been collaborating with Kang Dongyoon ([@kdy1dev](https://x.com/kdy1dev)) from the [swc](https://swc.rs/) team on adding additional support for React Compiler as an swc plugin. While this work isn't done, Next.js build performance should now be considerably faster when the [React Compiler is enabled in your Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/reactCompiler).

We recommend using Next.js [15.3.1](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v15.3.1) or greater to get the best build performance.

Vite users can continue to use [vite-plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) to enable the compiler, by adding it as a [Babel plugin](/learn/react-compiler/installation#vite). We are also working with the [oxc](https://oxc.rs/) team to [add support for the compiler](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/10048). Once [rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown) is officially released and supported in Vite and oxc support is added for React Compiler, we'll update the docs with information on how to migrate.

## What we're seeing in production {/*react-compiler-at-meta*/}
The compiler has already shipped in apps like Meta Quest Store. We've seen initial loads and cross-page navigations improve by up to 12%, while certain interactions are more than 2.5Ã— faster. Memory usage stays neutral even with these wins. Although your mileage may vary, we recommend experimenting with the compiler in your app to see similar performance gains.

## New apps should use React Compiler {/*new-apps-should-use-react-compiler*/}
We have partnered with the Expo, Vite, and Next.js teams to add the compiler to the new app experience.

[Expo SDK 54](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/) and up has the compiler enabled by default, so new apps will automatically be able to take advantage of the compiler from the start.

<TerminalBlock>
{`npx create-expo-app@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

[Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) users can choose the compiler enabled templates in `create-vite` and `create-next-app`.

<TerminalBlock>
{`npm create vite@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

<br />

<TerminalBlock>
{`npx create-next-app@latest`}
</TerminalBlock>

## Upgrading React Compiler {/*upgrading-react-compiler*/}
React Compiler works best when the auto-memoization applied is strictly for performance. Future versions of the compiler may change how memoization is applied, for example it could become more granular and precise.

However, because product code may sometimes break the [rules of React](/reference/rules) in ways that aren't always statically detectable in JavaScript, changing memoization can occasionally have unexpected results. For example, a previously memoized value might be used as a dependency for a `useEffect` somewhere in the component tree. Changing how or whether this value is memoized can cause over or under-firing of that `useEffect`. While we encourage [useEffect only for synchronization](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects), your codebase may have `useEffect`s that cover other use cases, such as effects that needs to only run in response to specific values changing.

In other words, changing memoization may under rare circumstances cause unexpected behavior. For this reason, we recommend following the Rules of React and employing continuous end-to-end testing of your app so you can upgrade the compiler with confidence and identify any rules of React violations that might cause issues.

If you don't have good test coverage, we recommend pinning the compiler to an exact version (eg `1.0.0`) rather than a SemVer range (eg `^1.0.0`). You can do this by passing the `--save-exact` (npm/pnpm) or `--exact` flags (yarn) when upgrading the compiler. You should then do any upgrades of the compiler manually, taking care to check that your app still works as expected.
