There is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components.

We recommend upgrading immediately.

</Intro>

---

On November 29th, Lachlan Davidson reported a security vulnerability in React that allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.

Even if your app does not implement any React Server Function endpoints it may still be vulnerable if your app supports React Server Components.

This vulnerability was disclosed as [CVE-2025-55182](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55182) and is rated CVSS 10.0.

The vulnerability is present in versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 of:

* [react-server-dom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-webpack)
* [react-server-dom-parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-parcel)
* [react-server-dom-turbopack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-turbopack?activeTab=readme)

## Immediate Action Required {/*immediate-action-required*/}

A fix was introduced in versions [19.0.1](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.0.1), [19.1.2](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.1.2), and [19.2.1](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.2.1). If you are using any of the above packages please upgrade to any of the fixed versions immediately.

If your app’s React code does not use a server, your app is not affected by this vulnerability. If your app does not use a framework, bundler, or bundler plugin that supports React Server Components, your app is not affected by this vulnerability.

### Affected frameworks and bundlers {/*affected-frameworks-and-bundlers*/}

Some React frameworks and bundlers depended on, had peer dependencies for, or included the vulnerable React packages. The following React frameworks & bundlers are affected: [next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next), [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router), [waku](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waku), [@parcel/rsc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parcel/rsc), [@vitejs/plugin-rsc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-rsc), and [rwsdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rwsdk).

See the [update instructions below](#update-instructions) for how to upgrade to these patches.

### Hosting Provider Mitigations {/*hosting-provider-mitigations*/}

We have worked with a number of hosting providers to apply temporary mitigations.

You should not depend on these to secure your app, and still update immediately.

### Vulnerability overview {/*vulnerability-overview*/}

[React Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions) allow a client to call a function on a server. React provides integration points and tools that frameworks and bundlers use to help React code run on both the client and the server. React translates requests on the client into HTTP requests which are forwarded to a server. On the server, React translates the HTTP request into a function call and returns the needed data to the client.

An unauthenticated attacker could craft a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint that, when deserialized by React, achieves remote code execution on the server. Further details of the vulnerability will be provided after the rollout of the fix is complete.

## Update Instructions {/*update-instructions*/}

<Note>

These instructions have been updated to include the new vulnerabilities:

- **Source Code Exposure - Medium Severity**: [CVE-2025-55183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183) (CVSS 5.3)

They also include the additional case found, patched, and disclosed as [CVE-2025-67779](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-67779).

### Next.js {/*update-next-js*/}

All users should upgrade to the latest patched version in their release line:

```bash
npm install next@14.2.35  // for 13.3.x, 13.4.x, 13.5.x, 14.x
npm install next@15.0.7   // for 15.0.x
npm install next@15.1.11  // for 15.1.x
npm install next@15.2.8   // for 15.2.x

npm install next@15.5.9   // for 15.5.x
npm install next@16.0.10  // for 16.0.x

npm install next@15.6.0-canary.60   // for 15.x canary releases
npm install next@16.1.0-canary.19   // for 16.x canary releases
```

If you are on version `13.3` or later version of Next.js 13 (`13.3.x`, `13.4.x`, or `13.5.x`) please upgrade to version `14.2.35`.

If you are on `next@14.3.0-canary.77` or a later canary release, downgrade to the latest stable 14.x release:

```bash
npm install next@14
```

See the [Next.js blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-update-2025-12-11) for the latest update instructions and the [previous changelog](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478) for more info.

### React Router {/*update-react-router*/}

If you are using React Router's unstable RSC APIs, you should upgrade the following package.json dependencies if they exist:

```bash
npm install react@latest
npm install react-dom@latest
npm install react-server-dom-parcel@latest
npm install react-server-dom-webpack@latest
npm install @vitejs/plugin-rsc@latest
```

### Expo {/*expo*/}

To learn more about mitigating, read the article on [expo.dev/changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog/mitigating-critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components).

### Redwood SDK {/*update-redwood-sdk*/}

Ensure you are on rwsdk>=1.0.0-alpha.0

For the latest beta version:

```bash
npm install rwsdk@latest
```

Upgrade to the latest `react-server-dom-webpack`:

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-webpack@latest
```

See [Redwood docs](https://docs.rwsdk.com/migrating/) for more migration instructions.

### Waku {/*update-waku*/}

Upgrade to the latest `react-server-dom-webpack`:

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-webpack@latest waku@latest
```

See [Waku announcement](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/discussions/1823) for more migration instructions.

### `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` {/*vitejs-plugin-rsc*/}

Upgrade to the latest RSC plugin:

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest @vitejs/plugin-rsc@latest
```

### `react-server-dom-parcel` {/*update-react-server-dom-parcel*/}

Update to the latest version:

 ```bash
 npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-parcel@latest
 ```

### `react-server-dom-turbopack` {/*update-react-server-dom-turbopack*/}

Update to the latest version:

 ```bash
 npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-turbopack@latest
 ```

### `react-server-dom-webpack` {/*update-react-server-dom-webpack*/}

Update to the latest version:

 ```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest react-server-dom-webpack@latest
 ```


### React Native {/*react-native*/}

For React Native users not using a monorepo or `react-dom`, your `react` version should be pinned in your `package.json`, and there are no additional steps needed.

If you are using React Native in a monorepo, you should update _only_ the impacted packages if they are installed:

- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

This is required to mitigate the security advisory, but you do not need to update `react` and `react-dom` so this will not cause the version mismatch error in React Native.

See [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/54772#issuecomment-3617929832) for more information.
