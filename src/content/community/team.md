<Intro>

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

<TeamMember name="Andrew Clark" permalink="andrew-clark" photo="/images/team/acdlite.jpg" github="acdlite" twitter="acdlite" threads="acdlite" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.

<TeamMember name="Dan Abramov" permalink="dan-abramov" photo="/images/team/gaearon.jpg" github="gaearon" bsky="danabra.mov" title="Independent Engineer">
    Dan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning [Sebastian](#sebastian-markbåge)'s tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.

<TeamMember name="Jack Pope" permalink="jack-pope" photo="/images/team/jack-pope.jpg" github="jackpope" personal="jackpope.me" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Shortly after being introduced to AutoHotkey, Jack had written scripts to automate everything he could think of. When reaching limitations there, he dove headfirst into web app development and hasn't looked back. Most recently, Jack worked on the web platform at Instagram before moving to React. His favorite programming language is JSX.

<TeamMember name="Jason Bonta" permalink="jason-bonta" photo="/images/team/jasonbonta.jpg" threads="someextent" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Jason abandoned embedded C for a career in front-end engineering and never looked back. Armed with esoteric CSS knowledge and a passion for beautiful UI, Jason joined Facebook in 2010, where he now feels privileged to have seen JavaScript development come of age. Though he may not understand how `for...of` loops work, he loves getting to work with brilliant people on projects that enable amazing UX.

<TeamMember name="Joe Savona" permalink="joe-savona" photo="/images/team/joe.jpg" github="josephsavona" twitter="en_JS" threads="joesavona" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Joe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he’s not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.

<TeamMember name="Josh Story" permalink="josh-story" photo="/images/team/josh.jpg" github="gnoff" twitter="joshcstory" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Josh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.

    Lauren's programming career peaked when she first discovered the `<marquee>` tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. She studied Finance instead of CS in college, so she learned to code using Excel instead of Java. Lauren enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, playing video games with her partner, and petting her dog Zelda.

<TeamMember name="Luna Wei" permalink="luna-wei" photo="/images/team/luna-wei.jpg" github="lunaleaps" twitter="lunaleaps" threads="lunaleaps" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Luna first learnt the fundamentals of python at the age of 6 from her father. Since then, she has been unstoppable. Luna aspires to be a gen z, and the road to success is paved with environmental advocacy, urban gardening and lots of quality time with her Voo-Doo’d (as pictured).

    Matt stumbled into coding, and since then, has become enamored with creating things in communities that can’t be created alone. Prior to React, he worked on YouTube, the Google Assistant, Fuchsia, and Google Cloud AI and Evernote. When he's not trying to make better developer tools he enjoys the mountains, jazz, and spending time with his family.

    Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he's not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.

<TeamMember name="Sathya Gunasekaran " permalink="sathya-gunasekaran" photo="/images/team/sathya.jpg" github="gsathya" twitter="_gsathya" threads="gsathya.03" title="Engineer at Meta">

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Markbåge" permalink="sebastian-markbåge" photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage" threads="sebmarkbage" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Silbermann" permalink="sebastian-silbermann" photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann" threads="sebsilbermann" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.

<TeamMember name="Seth Webster" permalink="seth-webster" photo="/images/team/seth.jpg" github="sethwebster" twitter="sethwebster" threads="sethwebster" personal="sethwebster.com" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

<TeamMember name="Sophie Alpert" permalink="sophie-alpert" photo="/images/team/sophiebits.jpg" github="sophiebits" twitter="sophiebits" threads="sophiebits" personal="sophiebits.com" title="Independent Engineer">
    Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project's #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn't getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she's still in the team's group chats and “providing value”.

<TeamMember name="Tianyu Yao" permalink="tianyu-yao" photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.

<TeamMember name="Yuzhi Zheng" permalink="yuzhi-zheng" photo="/images/team/yuzhi.jpg" github="yuzhi" twitter="yuzhiz" threads="yuzhiz" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
