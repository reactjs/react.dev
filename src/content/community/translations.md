## How to contribute {/*how-to-contribute*/}

You can contribute to the translation efforts! 

The community conducts the translation work for the React docs on each language-specific fork of react.dev. Typical translation work involves directly translating a Markdown file and creating a pull request. Click the "contribute" link above to the GitHub repository for your language, and follow the instructions there to help with the translation effort.
