title: Rendering Data
---

<Intro>


Data is the content that your UI displays. Data can come from many different sources and have different expectations on how it changes. Data fetching also introduces non-deterministic (unpredictable) behavior like loading and errors that your UI should properly communicate. In this chapter you'll learn how to fetch and render data as well as coordinate how your users experience loading and error states.
