title: Client React DOM APIs
---

<Intro>

The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A [framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) may call them for you. Most of your components don't need to import or use them.
