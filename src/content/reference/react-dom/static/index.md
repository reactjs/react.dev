title: Static React DOM APIs
---

<Intro>

The `react-dom/static` APIs let you generate static HTML for React components. They have limited functionality compared to the streaming APIs. A [framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) may call them for you. Most of your components don't need to import or use them.
