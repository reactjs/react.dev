title: cacheSignal
---

<RSC>

`cacheSignal` is currently only used with [React Server Components](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components).

</RSC>

<Intro>

`cacheSignal` allows you to know when the `cache()` lifetime is over.

```js
const signal = cacheSignal();
```

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `cacheSignal` {/*cachesignal*/}

Call `cacheSignal` to get an `AbortSignal`.

```js {3,7}
import {cacheSignal} from 'react';
async function Component() {
  await fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });
}
```

When React has finished rendering, the `AbortSignal` will be aborted. This allows you to cancel any in-flight work that is no longer needed.
Rendering is considered finished when:
- React has successfully completed rendering
- the render was aborted
- the render has failed

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

This function does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`cacheSignal` returns an `AbortSignal` if called during rendering. Otherwise `cacheSignal()` returns `null`.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

- `cacheSignal` is currently for use in [React Server Components](/reference/rsc/server-components) only. In Client Components, it will always return `null`. In the future it will also be used for Client Component when a client cache refreshes or invalidates. You should not assume it'll always be null on the client.
- If called outside of rendering, `cacheSignal` will return `null` to make it clear that the current scope isn't cached forever.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Cancel in-flight requests {/*cancel-in-flight-requests*/}

Call <CodeStep step={1}>`cacheSignal`</CodeStep> to abort in-flight requests.

```js [[1, 4, "cacheSignal()"]]
import {cache, cacheSignal} from 'react';
const dedupedFetch = cache(fetch);
async function Component() {
  await dedupedFetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });
}
```

<Pitfall>
You can't use `cacheSignal` to abort async work that was started outside of rendering e.g.

```js
import {cacheSignal} from 'react';
// ðŸš© Pitfall: The request will not actually be aborted if the rendering of `Component` is finished.
const response = fetch(url, { signal: cacheSignal() });
async function Component() {
  await response;
}
```
</Pitfall>

### Ignore errors after React has finished rendering {/*ignore-errors-after-react-has-finished-rendering*/}

If a function throws, it may be due to cancellation (e.g. <CodeStep step={1}>the Database connection</CodeStep> has been closed). You can use the <CodeStep step={2}>`aborted` property</CodeStep> to check if the error was due to cancellation or a real error. You may want to <CodeStep step={3}>ignore errors</CodeStep> that were due to cancellation.

```js [[1, 2, "./database"], [2, 8, "cacheSignal()?.aborted"], [3, 12, "return null"]]
import {cacheSignal} from "react";
import {queryDatabase, logError} from "./database";

async function getData(id) {
  try {
     return await queryDatabase(id);
  } catch (x) {
     if (!cacheSignal()?.aborted) {
        // only log if it's a real error and not due to cancellation
       logError(x);
     }
     return null;
  }
}

async function Component({id}) {
  const data = await getData(id);
  if (data === null) {
    return <div>No data available</div>;
  }
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
}
```
