* [`<Fragment>`](/reference/react/Fragment), alternatively written as `<>...</>`, lets you group multiple JSX nodes together.
* [`<Profiler>`](/reference/react/Profiler) lets you measure rendering performance of a React tree programmatically.
* [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) lets you display a fallback while the child components are loading.
* [`<StrictMode>`](/reference/react/StrictMode) enables extra development-only checks that help you find bugs early.
