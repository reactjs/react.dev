<Wip>

**This API is experimental and is not available in a stable version of React yet.**

You can try it by upgrading React packages to the most recent experimental version:

- `react@experimental`
- `react-dom@experimental`
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@experimental`

Experimental versions of React may contain bugs. Don't use them in production.
